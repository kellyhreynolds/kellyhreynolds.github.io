            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a math tutor and I love what I do!  I've been a certified middle school math teacher for the last seven years and am taking this year off from teaching to spend time with my new baby, Delton.  My experience is mostly in pre-algeba, algebra, and geometry.  Math makes me excited.  I love the order and predicability it brings; I think finding x is a treasure hunt, and congruent angles bring me joy.  My goal is to raise students' confidence in math so that they don't need me anymore!  I tutor out of my home near Wards Corner in Norfolk and just off the interstate.  I do my best to schedule tutoring sessions during naptimes so that I can give my students my full attention, but please understand that babies can be unpredictable and it is possible I may need to pick Delton up and hold him while we work or change a diaper if needed.

            <p>Mrs. Reynolds helped me understand what I was learning.  This was huge for me because I was one of those kids that does not understand math very well.  She offers a lot of advice on how to solve problems that makes sense and is easy to remember.

            <p>Mrs. Reynolds is very passionalte and genuinely cares about her students’ understanding.  She made me feel totally comfortable asking questions when I didn’t understand.  I’m definitely not a math student, but when she taught I really understood what she was teaching.

            <p>I missed school for a week.  I ended up missing 2-3 new topics in Geometry.  I struggled with the new material so I went to her tutoring sessions.  I got one of my highest test grades after tutoring.  She thoroughly explained the new material to me and helped me practice the new skills. -       Alicia</p>
