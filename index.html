                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <img class="img-circle" src="kelly-delton.png">
                <p>I'm a math tutor and I love what I do! I've been a middle school math teacher for the last seven years and I'm certified 6-12.  I am taking this year off from teaching to spend time with my new baby, Delton.  I miss the classroom but love staying home with my boy!  I'll work Delton's naptimes around tutoring so that I can give my students my full attention.</p>  
                <br>
                <p>
                During my years teaching I often tutored students before and after school.  As a tutor, my goal is to raise students' confidence in math so that they are able to reason through the material on their own.  I collaborate with the student and their classroom teacher to provide as much support as I can.  I care about my students and want to see them succeed!

                <p>Mrs. Reynolds helped me understand what I was learning.  This was huge for me because I was one of those kids that does not understand math very well.  She offers a lot of advice on how to solve problems that makes sense and is easy to remember.

                <br>
                <p>Mrs. Reynolds is very passionate and genuinely cares about her students’ understanding.  She made me feel totally comfortable asking questions when I didn’t understand.  I’m definitely not a math student, but when she taught I really understood what she was teaching.

                <p>I missed school for a week.  I ended up missing 2-3 new topics in Geometry.  I struggled with the new material so I went to her tutoring sessions.  I got one of my highest test grades after tutoring.  She thoroughly explained the new material to me and helped me practice the new skills. -       Alicia</p>

                <p>Mrs. Reynolds is a very patient, understanding, down to earth and overall nice teacher.  The way she explains things to her students is very helpful.  If you need help with math … GET MRS. REYNOLDS!
